#### Run analytical functions for each sub-simulations of GDAY
#### Output the necessary dataframe onto a cohesive framework,
#### so that they are available for cross-match with GDAY simulation results
####
#### This is the main script to call individual analytical run scripts and functions
####
#### Run definitions:
#### Run 1: baseline, variable wood stoichiometry, N and P cycles on,
####        implicit mineral N and P pools
#### Run 2: same as Run1, but P cycle off
#### Run 3: same as Run1, but fixed wood stoichiometry
#### Run 4: same as Run1, but autotrophic respiration as a function of plant N concentration
#### Run 5: same as Run4, but fixed wood stoichiometry and increased nutrient supply
#### Run 6: same as Run1, but with separate coarse woody debris pool
#### Run 7: same as Run1, but with explicit mineral N pool
#### Run 8.1: same as Run7, but with passive SOM fixed stoichiometry, and nuptake ~ root biomass - GDAY approach
#### Run 8.2, same as Run8.1, but with O-CN approach (i.e. saturating function of mineral N)
#### Run 9: same as Run7, but with passive NC ratio ~ mineral N pool
#### Run 10: same as Run1, but turned exudation on

#### Create dataframes to store all the data
constraintDF <- create_constraint_DF()
equilDF <- create_equil_DF()

#### Step 1: simply run analytical solution and plot quasi-equil plots
### f.flag: = 1 simply plot analytical solution graph
###         = 2 return constraintDF
###         = 3 return equilDF
Perform_Analytical_Run1_EucFACE(f.flag = 1, constraintDF, equilDF)
Perform_Analytical_Run2_EucFACE(f.flag = 1, constraintDF, equilDF)

#### Step 2 store run 1 - 10 constrainDF dataframe

### Run 1
constraintDF <- Perform_Analytical_Run1_EucFACE(f.flag = 2, constraintDF, equilDF)

### Run 2
constraintDF <- Perform_Analytical_Run2_EucFACE(f.flag = 2, constraintDF, equilDF)



#### Step 3 store run 1 - 10 equilDF dataframes

### Run 1
equilDF <- Perform_Analytical_Run1_EucFACE(f.flag = 3, constraintDF, equilDF)

### Run 2
equilDF <- Perform_Analytical_Run2_EucFACE(f.flag = 3, constraintDF, equilDF)
