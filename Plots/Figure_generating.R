#### Figure 1: 
#### Shoot N:C vs. production from analytical solution
#### No P considered, fixed plant stoichiometry
#### Purpose: to illustrate the concept of quasi-equilibrium interpretation
source("Plots/Figure1.R")

#### Figure 2: not plotted here, as this is the GDAY structure plot


#### Figure 3:
#### The 3-d plot of shoot N:C, shoot P:C vs. production
#### With the same assumption as Figure 1 (same coloring system)
#### Pupose: to illustrate the co-limitation concept
source("Plots/Figure3.R")

#### Figure 4:
#### To plot shoot P:C vs. production under eCO2 and aCO2,
#### specifically focuses on aCO2 condition where shoot P:C is constrained by
#### both VL and L constraints. 
source("Plots/Figure4.R")




#### Figure x:
#### To plot multi-panel transient model behaviors over the first 100 years of doubling CO2
#### comparing both fixed and variable wood stoichiometry
