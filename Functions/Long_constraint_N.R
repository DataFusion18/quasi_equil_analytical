### Function for nutrient N constraint in longterm ie passive, leaching, wood considered
Long_constraint_N <- function(df, a, Cpass, NinL) {
    # passed are df and a, the allocation and plant N:C ratios
    # parameters : 
    # Nin is fixed N inputs (N deposition annd fixation) in g m-2 yr-1 (could vary fixation)
    # nleach is the rate of n leaching of the mineral pool (per year)
    # Tsoil is effective soil temperature for decomposition
    # Texture is the fine soil fraction
    # ligfl and ligrl are the lignin:C fractions in the foliage and root litter
    # Cpass is the passive pool size in g C m-2
    # ncp is the NC ratio of the passive pool in g N g-1 C
    
    # passive pool burial 
    pass <- passive(df, a)

    U0 <- NinL + (1-pass$qq) * pass$decomp * Cpass * ncp   # will be a constant if decomp rate is constant
